# Partners Research Portal #
##User Access Provisioning##

Any Partners user can login to the Partners Research Portal using their Partners credentials to create and manage research projects. Account creation (which occurs on the first login), login, logout, and session timeout are audited to the SQL Server database. Users can be elevated to Admins via the Admin tool built into the PRP site. You must already be an administrator to grant Admin access to another user.  Admin privilege can also be revoked via the Admin tool.

Admin accounts will be reviewed on a semi-annual basis to ensure that only authorized users have admin access...
